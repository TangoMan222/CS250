Creating user stories can help a team identify and process the tasks and problem presented before them in an organized manner.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I have really enjoyed the idea of sprints and the close not community and communication involved within it and hope to incorporate it within future development projects.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member within software development is rather similar to being a good team member anywhere. A good team member emphazises communication as well as team collaboration.
